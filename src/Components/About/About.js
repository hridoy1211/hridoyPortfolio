                    <p className='paragraph'>Hello! My name is Hridoy and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My interest in web development started back in 2021 when I decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes â€” turns out hacking together a custom reblog button taught me a lot about HTML & CSS! I am passionate about leveraging my diverse backgrounds to decipher challenging problems and create delightful experiences. I honed my skills at web development. I develop websites with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have top skills in using design softwares like Figma,PhotoShop; with prototype tools like Framer and Protopie. Interested in the entire frontend spectrum and working on ambitious projects with positive people.</p>
